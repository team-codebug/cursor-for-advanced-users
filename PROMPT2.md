**Prompt:**
“Now, let’s create a clean, modern, and professional user interface for **‘BlogForge’**, our AI-powered blogging platform.

The layout should have a **dashboard-style structure**, featuring:

* A **top navigation bar** with the BlogForge logo, AI tools menu (Repurpose, Summarize, Tag), and a user avatar dropdown for profile and logout.
* A **left sidebar** with navigation links for *Dashboard*, *My Posts*, *Drafts*, *Tags*, and *Settings*.
* A **main content area** where users can view or edit blog posts using a markdown editor with a live preview panel.

Use **TailwindCSS** for styling with a **professional, minimal palette** — shades of **slate gray, deep indigo, and electric purple accents** for an AI-inspired aesthetic.
Ensure the layout feels **creative yet focused**, with subtle shadows, smooth transitions, and fully responsive behavior across devices.

Make sure the design supports **dark mode**, with muted backgrounds and glowing accent elements for the AI buttons (e.g., “✨ Repurpose to LinkedIn” and “🐦 Generate Tweet Thread”).

Ensure all visual components look cohesive and elegant while maintaining a tech-professional vibe suitable for modern creators.”
